### Summary
* Used npm and ```package.json``` file to manage dependencies.
* Created and configured an Express project. Set up MVC environment.
* Added Bootstrap and Font-awesome for layout.
* Published live URL on Heroku via Git.

### Notes
* Managing dependencies by using npm and a ```package.json``` file
  - npm is a package manager that gets installed with Node, which gives you the ability to download Node modules or packages to extend the functionality of your application
  - ```package.json```: contains metadata about a project, including dependencies
  - ```$ npm install``` tells npm to install all of the dependencies listed in the ```package.json``` file into a folder in the application called *node_modules*

  - ```$ npm install --save package-name``` tells npm to download and install the new package into the node_modules folder and add this package to the list of dependencies in the ```package.json``` file
* Creating and configuring Express projects
  - ```$ express``` installs the Express framework with default settings into a folder
  - Configuration options
    - Which HTML template engine to use (default: Jade)
      - HTML template engine: compile HTML template and data to final HTML markup for browser
      - Pug templates must be indented using spaces, not tabs!
    - Which CSS preprocessor to use (default: N/A)
    - Whether to create a ```.gitignore``` file
  - ```$ express --view=pug --git``` will create an Express project which uses Pug as the HTML template and generates a .gitignore file
  - ```$ DEBUG=loc8r:* npm start``` will run Express application and can be opened in browser with localhost:3000
  - Express middleware:
    - in ```app.js``` file there are ```app.use``` lines known as *middleware*.
    - All requests to Express server run through the middleware defined in ```app.js``` file

  - Node application compiles before running. Jade templates, CSS files and client-side JS can be updated on-the-fly.
    - use ```$ nodemon``` to restart
* Setting up an MVC environment
  - An architecture to separate out data (model), display (view) and application logic (control)
  ![ch3](/images/ch3-MVC.png)
  - In app_server: controller, models, routs, views
  - Split controllers from routes
    - Controllers manage application logic
    - Routing map URL requests to controllers
    - ```res.render(<view template>, <JS data object>)```
    - Take code out of a Node file to create an external module use ```export``` and ```require```
* Adding Twitter Bootstrap for layout
* Publishing to a live URL and using Git and Heroku
  - Need to tell Heroku via ```package.json```
    1. We are running a Node application using npm
    2. Versions
  - Procfile to declare types used by our application and commands used to start them
    - ```$ web: npm start``` tells Heroku the application needs a web process and it should run ```npm start```
  - Deploy via git

### Answers to Readme Note Questions
1. The default ```app.js``` file generated by Express declares variables using the ```var``` keyword. What are the two new keywords introduced in EcmaScript 6 that the author discusses, and what is his recommendation for declaring variables in ```app.js```?

    Answer:
    - The two new keywords that the author discusses are ```const``` and ```let```. Variables defined with ```const``` cannot be changed at a later point in the code, and variables defined with ```let``` can be changed.
    - What the author recommends is that we should always define variables with ```const``` unless the value is going to change and all instances of ```var``` in app.js can be changed to ```const```.

2. What do we call the process of mapping URL requests to the functionality we want to associate with the URL? For example, when the URL ```/``` is requested (this represents the base URL for our application's domain), we want to execute the controller function that renders our title page. What do we call the code that connects a URL request to our controller code?

    Answer:
    - The process of mapping URL requests to the functionality that we want to associate with is called *routing*, and the code is called ```router```.
