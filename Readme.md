### Answers to Readme Note Questions
1. The default app.js file generated by Express declares variables using the var keyword. What are the two new keywords introduced in EcmaScript 6 that the author discusses, and what is his recommendation for declaring variables in app.js?

Answer:
* The two new keywords that the author discusses are const and let. Variables defined with const cannot be changed at a later point in the code, and variables defined with let can be changed.
* What the author recommends is that we should always define variables with const unless the value is going to change and all instances of var in app.js can be changed to const.

What do we call the code that connects a URL request to our controller code?
